        <h1>AndCollective LLC Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>This policy was last updated on January 22, 2024.</p>
        <p>AndCollective LLC (“we”, “MAP”, “us” or “our”) has a firm commitment to respect and protect the privacy of users of the MAP website (a “Site”). This AndCollective LLC Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (this “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, and protect the personal information of users of our Site. By accessing, using, registering with, or providing personal information to the Site, you explicitly accept, without limitation or qualification, the collection, use, storage and transfer (including international transfer) in the manner described in this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time). THIS PRIVACY POLICY AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES UNDER THE LAW. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access or use the Site or provide us with personal information. Doing so will result in your audition being automatically rejected.</p>
        <p>The Site provides a range of content hosting and communication services, and seeks to connect talent, models, dancers, voice talent, hosts, potential contestants and show participants, and other artists (collectively, “Talent”) with professionals rendering professional services in motion picture, theatrical, radio, television and other entertainment enterprises (collectively, “Industry Professional Entities” and “Industry Professionals”).</p>

        <h2>Special notice to Talent</h2>
        <p>There are practical considerations relating to the need for Industry Professional Entities to review certain personal information, and to contact Talent for casting purposes. By registering and creating a profile on the Site you understand that you are affirmatively choosing to post personal information about yourself, including contact information such as your phone number and e-mail address, as well as physically identifying information such as your height, weight, hair, and eye color. You also have the option to post photographs, videos and other materials that may allow third parties to personally identify you. This information may be viewable outside of the Site via web search engines, which are outside of our control. By registering on the Site and submitting any such information, you acknowledge and agree that such personal information may be revealed to other Site users and the public, and that you are aware of the risks inherent in so doing.</p>

        <h2>Special note about minors</h2>
        <p>We are particularly concerned about the safety and privacy of all of our users, particularly individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 18, nor do we allow users under the age of 18 to directly establish their own profiles on the Site. All users under the age of 18 may only post profiles on the Site if they are represented by an adult agent or other authorized Industry Professional Entity, or by a parent or legal guardian who has registered on their behalf and who maintains the profile on their behalf (the “Registering Adult”). If we become aware that a profile has been established for an individual under the age of 18 without a Registering Adult, we will take steps to terminate such profile and remove any corresponding information.</p>
        <p>Users under the age of 18 may monitor and modify their profile and personal information posted on the Site under the supervision of the Registering Adult.</p>

        <h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website or any offline contact or communications external to the Site between MAP and any other company, you and MAP, or you and other registered users of the Site, or to information otherwise collected by third parties through social networking platforms.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy updates</h2>
        <p>MAP may modify, supplement or replace this Privacy Policy from time to time, and may do so at our discretion, consistent with applicable data protection laws and rules. Any revisions to our Privacy Policy will be posted here, as well as a notice in a prominent location on the Sites and, if we have a way and are legally permitted to do so, we will make an effort to contact you by email in the event this Privacy Policy is materially changed. You are required to agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy in order to maintain your Site profile. Any revised policy will supersede and replace previous privacy policies, effective as of the date on which it is posted. Your use of the Sites after any revised Privacy Policy has been posted represents and confirms your consent and agreement to all such changes.</p>

        <h2>Third party links</h2>
        <p>The Site may contain links to websites operated by third parties (“Third Party Sites”) that are outside of our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not endorse and are not in any way responsible for the privacy policies, content, and/or practices of such Third Party Sites. You should review the privacy policy of all Third Party Sites so you can understand how they collect, use, store and transfer or share your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Types of information we collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information on our Site:</p>
        <ul>

This may also include information about third parties, such as references or contacts (for example, a director or photographer with whom you have worked previously) that you provide to us if you have their express written consent to do so.</p>
        <p>The collection and use of your personal information may be necessary for us to provide you with positive and customized experience on the Site, to provide you with a product or service, to communicate with you, or maintain our relationship with you. We do not collect your personal information unless you or someone who is expressly authorized by you (or if you are under 18, the Registering Adult) chooses to provide it to us.</p>
        <p>You are not required to give us any personal information in order to read the content portions of our Site. However, please note that if you choose not to provide us with personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions and features of our Site.</p>

Note that it is against the Privacy Policy to enter or otherwise provide any government identifier (such as a Social Security number, Tax ID number, or Medicare number) in your profile or any other area of the Site.</p>
        <p>If we become aware that you have provided any government identifiers in your profile or anywhere else on the Site, we reserve the right to immediately delete that information.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>How we use your information</h2>

        </ul>

        <p>When you create or post a profile to the Site, that profile is stored in our searchable talent database in the United States. Once posted, your profile will be searchable, and all third parties with access to our searchable talent database (or copies thereof) will have access to your profile. Industry Professionals or other third parties with access to our searchable talent database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country. For example, your profile may be viewed and accessed by Industry Professionals outside the European Economic Area who have access to our searchable talent database. We strive to provide a safe and secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but we cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorized users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to your profile.</p>
